# Hidden Markov Model for Java (HMMTK4j)

HMMTK4J is a set of Java classes to do various computation on Hidden Markov Models in Java.
To achieve good performance in computation, a JNI implementation using [ALTERnatives](https://gitlab.projectsforge.org/hmm/alternatives) is used.
Currently it only supports GNU/Linux and MS Windows both in 32bits/64bits version.
